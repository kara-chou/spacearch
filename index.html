                <p>How do we think about designing architecture for humans in space?</p>
                <p><strong>Human-Environment Connection & Interaction Atlas (HECIA)</strong> explores behavioral risks associated with isolated, confined, and extreme environments, in particular spaceflight. We visually depict the intricate connections between the human and the environment through a "Directed Acyclic Graph" -- meaning the connections never form a loop. Recognizing the complexity of human-environment relationship, this framework serves as a starting point to consider relationships between habitat and human, and where design can strengthen, modify, and interact with these relationships.</p>
                <p>The homepage is an overview of factors associated with designing human habitation in these environments. <strong>Zoom</strong> into each subsequent layer to add more complexity. <strong>Hover</strong> over each box for their definitions. <strong>Click</strong> on a factor and hover over its related boxes to read about their relationships.</p>
                <p>This framework is a point of departure. The relationships mapped here are just as important as the arguments, reactions, and agreements that follow. We welcome thoughts and dialogue sent to <br> hecia-info@mit.edu </p>
