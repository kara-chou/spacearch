        explanation: 
            "Astronaut selection was originally carried out by NASA and the Soviet Space Program, and now Japan, China, Russia, Brazil, and countries in Europe have selected their own astronauts <span style='color:gray'>[NASA 2024]</span>. Due to historical and sociopolitical factors, only male candidates were originally allowed to become astronauts, with one exception in the early 1960s (Valentina Tereshkova, USSR). Female candidates were accepted regularly in the 1980s, although still comprise a minority of the program [Steimle and Norberg 2013]. <br><br> Selection criteria include educational/professional qualifications and candidates must be able to pass the astronaut physical, medical, and psychological exams. More restrictively, astronaut candidates from most programs must exhibit mental and personal capabilities which are selected for and evaluated by a panel of experts <span style='color:gray'>[Steimle and Norberg 2013]</span>. <br><br><br> <span style='color:gray'>NASA.

        title: "Distance From Home/Earth",

Therefore, “home” may be multiple, constructed, and changing as one leaves and creates new homes.

Supplies may include personal effects, logistical support (e.g., vacuum, trash bags), scientific equipment (e.g., rodents, plants, test tubes), ECLSS (e.g., water filters, CO2 regeneration substrates), and tools. Certain supplies have been defined separately due to their relative significance, for instance food/water and medical supplies. <br>  Note that supplies are defined separately from fixtures, which is an arbitrary distinction at times. In general, we would describe supplies as items that are meant to be replaced on a more regular basis than fixtures, which may be intended to serve the same function for the lifespan of the habitat.

        explanation: "Nostalgia and homesickness arise from the loss of people and places <span style='color:gray'>[Brown and Perkins 1992]</span>. Often following events of “disruption”, such as voluntary migration or involuntary displacement, feelings of homesickness are often experienced, multifaceted, and change in intensity over time <span style='color:gray'>[Brown and Perkins 1992]</span>. While promoting attachment to a new place or with new people can help, homesickness often arises independently of the quality of attachment in the new setting <span style='color:gray'>[Brown and Perkins 1992]</span>. <br> Place attachment to a home may induce homesickness when moving away from home. In a study of 200 college students in Italy, it was found that strong home attachment positively predicted homesickness <span style='color:gray'>[Scopelliti and Tiberio 2010]</span>. In more severe cases, dysfunctional place attachment/dependence can arise, particularly when the place that one wishes to return to is no longer possible <span style='color:gray'>[Fried 2000]</span>.     <br><br><br> <span style='color:gray'> Brown, B.
